# GuessTheNumber
Simple python project where user tries to guess number generated by computer

Every set number of attempts ('prompts') the user is prompted with the option to give up, which results in the output of their number of attempts and the answer.
User is able to set the range of numbers the computer can choose from using lower limit ('lLimit') and upper limit ('uLimit')

The user is informed of if their guess each time is higher or lower than the answer, and if they are successful the answer and number of attempts is printed (same as for if they give up but with success message).
